## Introduction 🚀
This project is a web application that uses a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease. The model is trained on a dataset containing features like age, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate. The application is built using Flask for the backend, HTML/CSS for the frontend, and a pre-trained logistic regression model for predictions.
